This is my solution to the [Huddle Landing Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. Figma design and all assets were provided by Frontend Mentor. The UI design was provided by Frontend Mentor and the solution was coded by me.
